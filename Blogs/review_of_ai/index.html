    <h1 class="animated">Reflection on AI in Programming</h1>

    <p class="animated">Recently, I have been working on some problems where I wanted to utilize a set of tools and technologies. Although I am familiar with these technologies, I found myself unable to code effectively without the assistance of AI. As an undergraduate student, I often feel a sense of guilt when I rely on AI to build an application or program. While completing the program provides a sense of satisfaction, deep down, it feels like I am merely "painting by numbers" rather than truly creating something from scratch.</p>

    <p class="animated">I disagree with the notion that AI is universally beneficial or that relying on it is entirely acceptable. One of the most beautiful aspects of programming is the joy of building something entirely on your own. This process of creation is deeply satisfying and irreplaceable.</p>

    <p class="animated">Let me clarify—I am not dismissing the value of AI-driven applications outright. The programs or apps we create using AI might provide short-term happiness, but in the long run, they can hinder personal growth. Over-reliance on AI could lead to regrets, as the lack of foundational skills might become a significant obstacle in the future.</p>

    <blockquote class="animated">
        "Don’t chase trends or fall into the honeypots of companies. At the end of the day, your programming skills and problem-solving abilities matter most."
    </blockquote>

    <p class="animated">Programming is, at its core, an art form. True artistry in programming doesn’t come easily; it requires persistence, practice, and a willingness to learn through trial and error. Just as a masterpiece in art demands effort, so does excellence in programming.</p>

    <p class="animated">In conclusion, while AI tools can offer support, it is crucial to maintain a focus on manual learning and skill development. Don’t let your skills and creativity be overshadowed by dependence on tools. Embrace the journey of learning and creating, and let programming remain an expression of your hard-earned expertise and artistic vision.</p>
